**Project Management as Code (PMAC) Pitch**

"How much energy do you wanna spend on that?"

**What is PMAC?**
PMAC (Project Management as Code) is a revolutionary approach to managing projects. It treats project plans, team roles, Jira tickets, sprint structures, documentation, and even meeting cadences as version-controlled code. By codifying every aspect of project management, PMAC introduces reproducibility, testability, automation, and hybrid human-AI collaboration into the project lifecycle.

PMAC treats project management artifactsâ€”like team roles, sprints, documentation, Jira tickets, and even meeting structures as declarative code, version-controlled in Git, validated through automated tests, and integrated into your pipelines.

Version-controlled project management structures enhances GitOps, DevSecOps, and yadayada-as-Code with Test Driven Development and future-thinking AI / human hybrid teams.

**Why PMAC?**
- **Reproducibility:** Clone, spin up, and relaunch entire projects like infrastructure code.
- **Automation-Ready:** Generate Jira boards, GitHub repos, Confluence docs, and Slack channels from a single JSON file.
- **Human + AI Collaboration:** Standardized role schemas allow AI agents to contribute alongside human team members.
- **Test-Driven Project Management:** PMAC validates project drift with automated tests, providing alerts and proposed fixes.
- **Single Source of Truth:** Git becomes the unified logbook of all project activities and state.

**Key Benefits**
- AI incorporated into project teams as coworkers with escalation policies
- Reduce time kick starting a project & onboarding
- Detect and fix project drift automatically
- Standardize projects across teams and orgs
- Generate documentation, enhance jira stories, and create action items on demand
- Eliminate context switching between Jira, Confluence, GitHub, and Slack

**How It Works**
1. Define your project in structured JSON/YAML
2. Store it in Git for versioning and change tracking
3. Use CLI or GitHub Actions to generate real-world artifacts:
   - Jira issues
   - GitHub repos & branches
   - Sprint schedules & calendars
   - Confluence or Markdown documentation
   - Slack or Teams channels
4. Test the current state against the expected configuration
5. Log changes, AI suggested tasks & triage, and assign responsibilities automatically

**Integrations**
- **Jira / Confluence / Slack / GitHub / GitLab / Microsoft Teams / AWS IAM / Terraform / OpenAI / Notion / MDC / policytech**

**Who's It For?**
- Engineering teams with complex multi-team projects. Ideal for hybrid global teams dealing with timezone complexities and incorporating "AI Agents". Escalation policies, auto-scaling, failback procedures, hand-offs between traditional software <-> AI agents <-> People <->(timezones, PTO). 
- DevOps & Platform teams automating CI/CD and standardizing org structure
- Startups standardizing repeatable project templates with ideal setups
- Enterprises needing audit trails and security enforcement

**PMAC is GitOps for Processes,People,AI.**
